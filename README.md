Serve files from an SD-card using Me No Dev's async webserver for the ESP32 and ESP8266

This library is adapted from an example by pim-borst, https://gist.github.com/pim-borst/17934bfd4454caea3ba4f74366c2135c 
The commit history of the src files can be found [here](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/commits/esp32/firmware/AsyncSDServer.ino). I couldn't find a good way to include this history in new repo (maybe could add it as a patch later), but it's fairly short.
A huge thanks to libbymiller, who adapted the original adaptation to work for the ESP32.

To use this repo, clone it to the library directory of your arduino/C++ project. You can find example sketchs of how to use this library in the `examples` directory.

I am currently leaving this repo unlicensed because it includes a lot of other peoples work and pim-borst's original code did not contain a license.
